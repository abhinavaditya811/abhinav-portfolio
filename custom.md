### Project 5
- **Project Name**: `'Smart Scout' Football Analytics`
- **Project URL** (GitHub, live demo, etc.): `https://github.com/Samarth1337/Smart-Scout-Football-Analytics`
- **Brief Description** (optional): `Devise from the following: Find similar players to current players (metrics could be market value, age, clean sheets, goals, assists, etc.), this will help clubs decide whether they should renew contracts of the existing players or replace them with other similar ones. & The substitution dynamics tell us how these players are being used so far in their current clubs and brings context to their performances. Youth players are usually used as sub-ins for a team as they develop, but Xavi Simmons transcends this notion and displays first-team quality. Having been subbed out more times than being subbed in suggests that he starts for the team more often than being on the bench which would indicate that the player has the trust of the current team and manager. This could bode well for the player and could be used as a metric when being considered as an investment opportunity for another club. Harvey Elliot is on the cusp of making this transition. Arsen and Rayan are often called for sub-ins as well while Arda hasn't gotten opportunity to prove himself. (Assumption: Youth players usually don't play the entirety of the game) Conclusions:
Harvey Elliott exhibits an impressive upward trend in his performance over time, paralleled by a notable efficiency on the field in terms of goals per minute, signaling consistent development and untapped potential. His market value appears modest relative to his goal contributions, presenting an attractive prospect for clubs seeking value for money. Xavi Simons has demonstrated remarkable first-team quality, reflected by his frequent starting position and lower substitution rate. His performance trend, combined with a robust efficiency in both goals and assists, underlines his value on the pitch. His ability to influence games and consistent performance suggests he is a sound investment, likely to contribute immediately and in the long term.Rayan Cherki, while showing a decline in form, maintains a high level of assist efficiency. The dip in performance might be a temporary form issue or could point to underlying issues needing attention. However, his reasonable market value coupled with a high assists rate presents a potentially high-reward investment if his form can be rejuvenated. Arsen Zakharyan and Arda Güler have less data to draw from, limiting a definitive assessment of their trajectory. Güler, in particular, stands out for his goals-per-minute efficiency, but the small sample size suggests caution. Further monitoring of their development and more consistent playtime is required to adequately judge their potential for investment. In terms of discipline, no player appears to be particularly problematic, which is promising for clubs concerned about the impact of disciplinary issues on team dynamics. Overall, Harvey Elliott and Xavi Simons emerge as the strongest candidates for investment based on the analyzed data. Elliott offers an excellent price-to-performance ratio, while Simons showcases qualities of a developed and reliable midfielder. Both players could be expected to enhance a club's performance with their current trajectory and skill set. Clubs should consider these factors in the context of their strategic needs and the potential for these young talents to integrate into their existing squad dynamics.`
